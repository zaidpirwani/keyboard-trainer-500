# AI Prompts Record

This file contains the prompts and context used for AI-assisted development of this project.

## Initial Task (2026-02-09)

### Prompt 1: Format README
```
format the readme, dont use emojis or too much LLM, keep it simple, clean and short

add some AI generated ideas and suggestions in a SEPARATE file - name it ai-ideas
```

**Context:** Original README was informal with mixed content (personal story + ideas)

**Initial Approach:** Created overly formal README, removed all personality

**Result:** Too sterile, lost the human element and project purpose

---

## Revision Task (2026-02-09)

### Prompt 2: Keep Personality, Add Structure
```
Ideas are fine, but in the readme, You have removed all personality. Humanity, emotion and reason.

Try again, keep the original readme content and meaning, just format it and add some basic formatting, text etc to make it clearer, don't talk about libraries yet. Keep my ideas in the main readme and give your new, original ideas in the ai ideas file.

Remember, the main purpose for this project is to make using a keyboard fun for my little ones, 6 and 7 yr and also as a physical guide to learn keyboard and ultimately be able to do reasonably fast typing. 

Main ingredient, pi 500 plus, RGB mechanical keyboard

Support components. Screen, mouse

Am not thinking about user profiles etc or saving anything, this is a stand alone and one off project. For personal, home use

Use above as general feedback, also add this and the previous main task in an ai prompts file as well for record.
```

**Key Requirements:**
- Maintain personal story about kids (6 and 7 years old)
- Keep original ideas IN the README
- Add only formatting/structure, not corporate tone
- Focus: Making keyboard learning fun for kids
- Hardware: Pi 500 Plus with RGB mechanical keyboard
- Scope: Personal, home use, standalone project (no profiles/saving)
- AI file should contain NEW ideas, not user's original ideas

**Approach:** 
- Preserved conversational tone and emoji :)
- Added markdown structure for clarity
- Kept all original ideas in README
- Moved AI-generated suggestions to separate file
- Focused AI ideas on kid-friendly features
- Created this prompts file for documentation

**Key Learning:** Balance structure with authenticity. Technical documentation can still have personality and purpose.

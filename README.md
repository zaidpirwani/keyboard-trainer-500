# Keyboard Trainer 500

Recently got a Pi 500 plus, this is my first mechanical keyboard with RGBs and the best part is, these RGBs I can code via python.

So I thought, why not make a keyboard typing trainer from this. My 2 little ones (6 and 7 years old) were having fun typing short stories on it, but they were having some difficulty finding the right letters. :)

**Main Goal:** Make using a keyboard fun for kids and serve as a physical guide to learn keyboard and ultimately be able to do reasonably fast typing.

**Main Ingredient:** Pi 500 plus RGB mechanical keyboard  
**Supporting Components:** Screen, mouse

## Current Status

For now, this is terminal-based.

## Resources

- Documentation: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/keyboard-computers.html#advanced-led
- Pi keyboard config tool: https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-keyboard-config

## Ideas for Features

- Light up/blink key which is to be pressed
- Colorful GUI
- What to write can be hidden/shown
- Sounds?
- Keys should light up based on finger position - every finger has a specific color (red for index, green for ring, and so on)
- Inverted mode: all light up, required key is blank/off
- Animations, reactive animations
- Some more emotion, colors
- Speed indication via lighting up other keys (number keys, function keys)
- Usage of modifier keys?
- Keyboard race: letters appear and user types fast behind the letters
- Simon Says, but for keyboard

## Note

This is a standalone, one-off project for personal home use. Not thinking about user profiles or saving anything at this stage.

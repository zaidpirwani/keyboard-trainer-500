Recently got a Pi 500 plus, this is my first mechanical keyboard with RGBs and the best part is, these RGBs I can code via python.

So I thought, why not make a keyboard typing trianer from this, my 2 little ones were having fun typing short stories on it, but they were having some difficulty finding the right letters. :)

Pi keyboard config tool: https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-keyboard-config

For now, this is terminal

some ideas
light up blink key, which is to be pressed
colorful GUI
what to write can be hidden / shown
sounds ?
keys should light up based on finger position - every finger has a specific color, red for index, green for ring and so on

inverted mode, all light up, required key is blank/off

animations, reactive animations
some more emotion, colors

speed indication, via lighting up other keys, number, fn keys
usage of modifier keys ?

keybopard race, letters appear and user types fast behind the letters

sam says, but for keyboard
